A comprehensive solution to the [Space Tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWlf1GfW). This project has been expanded with custom pages (Video, Contact) and built using a robust, type-safe architecture with React and TypeScript, complete with an automated CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 🎨 Overview

The goal was to build a multi-page space tourism website matching the design as closely as possible. Users are able to:

- View optimal layouts for each page depending on device screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements
- Navigate between different pages (Home, Destination, Crew, Technology)
- Access additional custom pages (Video, Contact)

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Fully Responsive** — Meticulous adaptation for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop viewports.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering** — Content for Crew, Destinations, and Technology pages is fetched and rendered dynamically from a local JSON file.
- **Custom Pages** — Added `Video` and `Contact` pages to demonstrate extended routing and form handling capabilities.
- **Modern Styling** — Utilized Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Type-Safe** — Full TypeScript support for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Automated Pipeline (CI/CD)** — Every push and pull request is automatically built and tested using GitHub Actions.
- **Strict Code Quality** — Integrated with SonarCloud to ensure the codebase remains clean, secure, and maintainable (Zero Security Hotspots).
